# Get Next Line

## Description
The **Get Next Line** project implements a C function that enables reading a file or standard input line by line, without loading the entire content at once. This function, `get_next_line`, uses an adjustable buffer to manage reading, making it efficient for processing large amounts of data or continuous input streams.

## Objective
Develop skills in file manipulation and memory management while introducing the use of static variables to persist data between function calls.
